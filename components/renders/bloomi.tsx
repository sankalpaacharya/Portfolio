        As a college student living in a hostel, managing expenses is really
        crucial to make sure you&apos;re not overspending on pizzas 🍕.

      <p>
        My friends and I always debate about who spends more money on junk food.
        We keep promising to hit the gym regularly and stay away from junk, but
        those promises never last.

        I wanted to make expense tracking more fun and social — something where
        you can track your spending with friends with leaderboard and ofc
        without having to manually fill every field.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&apos;s why I started building Bloomi — apps like YNAB or other
        money managers aren&apos;t UI-friendly, and their UX didn&apos;t match
        how I wanted to use an expense tracker.
      </p>
      <p>
        I needed a simple expense tracker where you can capture an image and
        instantly add an expense.
      </p>
      <p>I spent free time of my summar vacation working on this</p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m not actively working on Bloomi at the moment, but I&apos;ll
        definitely be adding more features in the future.
